## Notes related to M.2 Card
The M.2 devices installed in Helios64 is configured as sharing devices with SATA Port 1.
Therefore if you install M.2 SATA module, you will not be able to access the SATA Port 1.
In another case, if you use the M.2 USB module, the SATA Port 1 still accessible from the system.

The USB bus is connected to the EHCI Host 0.

The M.2 socket in the Helios64 board does NOT support the USB modem, because the USB modem require the SIM Card connection and another signal.
