## **Install Method**
There is several ways to install OS to your Helios64 board:

**1. [Install to micro-SD Card](/helios64/install-1)<br>**
**2. [Install to the eMMC module via micro-SD Card](/helios64/install-2)<br>**
**3. [Install to eMMC module directly via USB-C cable](/helios64/install-3)<br>**
**4. [Install on USB drive](/helios64/install-4)<br>**
**5. [Install on M.2 NVMe drive](/helios64/install-5)<br>**

Different choice of storage resulting in different IO read/write speed, this may affect the performance of installed OS.

## **What you need before you start.**

**1. microSD Card<br>**
